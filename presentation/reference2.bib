  Abstract                 = {In May 2008, the commission on growth
 and development (the growth commission) issued its report
 entitled 'the growth report'. In it the commission
 attempted to distill what had been learned in the past two
 decades, from experience and academic and policy research,
 about strategies and policies that produced sustained high
 growth in developing countries. It became clear in the
 course of the work that politics, leadership, and political
 economy (the interaction of economic and political forces
 and choices) were centrally important ingredients in the
 story. Dealing with the politics and the interaction of
 political and economic forces is a work in progress in
 research, an important one. Given this breadth, one of the
 editors' roles is to focus the reader's attention
 on what they take to be common issues across these chapters.
 These common problems are fourfold: (1) promoting national
 unity; (2) building good, solid institutions; (3) choosing
 innovative and localized policies; and (4) creating
 political consensus for long-run policy implementation. This
 report represent an excellent first step toward
 understanding the role of leadership in generating economic
 growth, and the author hope that they generate ideas and
 lead to new research on the problem of leadership in
 economic growth.},

  isbn      = {9780262018142},
  abstract  = {<p>Corrupt, mismanaged, and seemingly hopeless: that's how the international community viewed Nigeria in the early 2000s. Then Nigeria implemented a sweeping set of economic and political changes and began to reform the unreformable. This book tells the story of how a dedicated and politically committed team of reformers set out to fix a series of broken institutions, and in the process repositioned Nigeria's economy in ways that helped create a more diversified springboard for steadier long-term growth. The author, Harvard- and MIT-trained economist Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, currently Nigeria's Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance and formerly Managing Director of the World Bank, was a crucial player in her country's economic reforms. In Nigeria's Debt Management Office and later as minister of finance, she spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club of Creditors that led to the cancellation of sixty percent of Nigeria's external debt. Reforming the Unreformable offers an insider's view of those debt negotiations; it also details the fight against corruption and the struggle to implement a series of macroeconomic and structural reforms. Nigeria's efforts can be viewed as a laboratory for other countries--not just resource-rich developing countries like Nigeria, but any country interested in reining in debt, managing volatility, saving for the future, or building credibility with debtors and investors. This story of development economics in action, written from the front lines of economic reform in Africa, offers a unique perspective on the complex and uncertain global economic environment.</p>},
